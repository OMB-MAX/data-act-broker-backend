### Validate A, B, C Files
- File-level validation begins automatically on completion of `finalize_job` call
- Check status of validations using `/v1/check_status/`. For details on its use, click [here](./dataactbroker/README.md#get-v1check_status)
- Continue polling with `check_status` until the following keys have a `status` of `finished` or `failed`:
    - `appropriations`
    - `program_activity`
    - `award_financial`
    - **NOTE**: If any of these have a status of `ready` that means they were never started.
- To get a general overview of the number of errors/warnings in the submission, along with all other metadata, `/v1/submission_metadata/` can be called. For details on its use, click [here](./dataactbroker/README.md#get-v1submission_metadata)
- To get detailed information on each of the jobs and the errors that occurred in each, `/v1/submission_data/` can be called. For details on its use, click [here](./dataactbroker/README.md#get-v1submission_data)
- If there are any errors and more granular detail is needed, get the error reports by calling `/v1/submission/SUBMISSIONID/report_url/` (POST) where `SUBMISSIONID` is the ID of the submission
    - Payload:
        - `file_type`: string, type of the file to get warnings/errors for (see above types for valid options)
        - `warning`: boolean (`true` for warning files, `false` for error files)
    - Response:
        - `url`: string, direct url to the error/warning report
- If a reupload is needed for any of the files, begin again from `submit_files` with these changes:
    - Only pass the keys of the files being updated (e.g. if only appropriations needs a reupload, you will pass `appropriations: "FILENAME"` as an entry in the payload but not the other two.
    - Add the key `existing_submission_id` with the ID of the submission as the content (string).
    - Response will update to not include the IDs and keys for any files that were not resubmitted
    - Only call `finalize_job` on the updated files

### Generate D1, D2 Files

        - `size`: int, size of file (always null for some reason, should only be null until file is finished)
        - `status`: string, status of file generation
        - `url`: string, full url of the D file ("#" if not generated or error)
- Step 2: Poll `/v1/check_generation_status/` (POST) for each D file individually to see if generation has completed. Pinging should continue until status is not `waiting` or `running`
    - Payload:
        - `submission_id`: string, ID of the submission that was created
        - `file_type`: string, type of D file (can only be "D1" or "D2")
    - Response:

### Cross-file validations
- Cross-file validation begins automatically upon successful completion of D file generation (no errors)
- Poll using the `check_status` route in the same manner as described in `Validate A, B, C Files` except the key being looked at should be `cross`. The same endpoints can also be used to gather the submission metadata and cross-file job data.
- To get a specific error/warning file, call `/v1/submission/SUBMISSIONID/report_url/`(POST) where SUBMISSIONID is the ID of the submission
    - Header:
        - `X-Session-ID`: string, session token id
    - Payload:
        - `file_type`: string, the base file being compared against
        - `cross_type`: string, the secondary file being compared against
        - `warning`: boolean (true for warning files, false for error files)
    - Response:
        - `url`: string, direct url to the error/warning report
    - Valid file/cross type pairings (all other pairings will result in invalid URLs):
        - `file_type`: "appropriations", `cross_type`: "program\_activity"
        - `file_type`: "program\_activity", `cross_type`: "award\_financial"
        - `file_type`: "award\_financial", `cross_type`: "award\_procurement"

        - `status`: string, status of file generation
        - `url`: string, full url of the D file ("#" if not generated or error)
- Poll `/v1/check_generation_status/` (POST) for each file individually to see if generation has completed. Pinging should continue until status is not `waiting` or `running`
    - Payload:
        - `submission_id`: string, ID of the submission that was created
        - `file_type`: string, type of file (can only be "E" or "F")
    - Response:
